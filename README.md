# Searche

A javascript app built with developers in mind! Linked up to the Google, Wikipedia, and StackOverflow APIS, Searche allows you to search and create topics. You then have the ability to add to those topics and revisit the site!

## Getting Started

To get started, clone down the project. For the backend files, run 'bundle install' 'rails:db migrate' and 'rails db:seed'. In the terminal open the 'index.html' file.

### Prerequisites

The app is preloaded with the required gems.
