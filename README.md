# Searche

A JavaScript app built with developers in mind! Linked up to the Google, Wikipedia, and StackOverflow APIS, Searche allows you to search and create topics. You then have the ability to add to those topics and revisit the site!

## Motivation

As coding students, we found that we were spending a lot of time switching between different resources to find in depth information. We decided to create an app where a user could search the Google, Wikipedia, and StackOverflow APIs at the same time. After completing a search, a user is able to save to a topic from any of the three resources in one place. Thus allowing students to return to the app and review past searches across the different resources. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone down the project. For the backend files, run 'bundle install' 'rails:db migrate' and 'rails db:seed'. In the terminal open the 'index.html' file.
